# Are Electric Cars truely green? Emission Impact Analysis

Conducted a comprehensive Data Science analysis examining the environmental impact of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption in China, accounting for both road emissions reduction and battery production emissions. The analysis used Bayesian Statistics and probabilistic modeling to simulate real-world scenarios based on historical data.
Key Components:

- Developed statistical models to analyze historical data and identify critical transition points in emissions patterns
- Conducted deep-dive analysis of identified turning points to understand key contributing factors
- Created forecasting models using Bayesian statistics to project future emission trends and simulate long-term environmental impact scenarios"
